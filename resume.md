## EXPERIENCE

### LEVELUPINTECH | Cloud Engineer
**Sep 2023 – Feb 2024**

- Established reusable IaC patterns for multi-tier AWS architectures by engineering modular Terraform Cloud configurations across ALB, Auto Scaling, and RDS with private subnet isolation, identity-scoped security boundaries, and zero-drift convergence across multiple AZs.

- Owned AI pipeline delivery by architecting a review-first GitHub Actions CI/CD platform integrating Amazon Bedrock with throttling-aware fallback logic and DynamoDB analytics persistence, eliminating 100% of manual deployment steps across fully isolated beta and production environments.

- Defined event-driven infrastructure standards by designing serverless Lambda pipelines triggered via S3 ObjectCreated events with Amazon Rekognition, producing versioned, auditable classification artifacts per deployment across 2 structurally isolated environments.

- Standardized multilingual content delivery by architecting an automated audio localization pipeline using Transcribe, Translate, and Polly with end-to-end Lambda event execution and Terraform IaC, reducing manual processing overhead to zero.

- Hardened cloud security posture by establishing least-privilege IAM boundaries, integrating GuardDuty for continuous threat detection, and enforcing KMS encryption across all provisioned environments, identity-scoped at every tier.

- Automated IAM governance and EC2 lifecycle management by engineering Lambda and EventBridge workflows with tag-based enforcement, API Gateway triggers, and full DynamoDB audit logging, cutting estimated manual overhead by 80% with zero production impact.

- Enforced infrastructure compliance standards by implementing CI repository validation, structured CloudWatch audit logging, and OIDC federated authentication across 8+ projects, eliminating long-lived credentials from every deployment workflow.

- Owned container orchestration platform by deploying Docker Swarm across multi-node clusters with secrets-managed credentials, durable volume persistence, and control plane-enforced failure recovery.

### LIFE TIME FITNESS | IT Service Desk Technician
**Jan 2015 – Aug 2020 | Burlington, MA**

- Escalation point for enterprise identity and access issues, managing Active Directory account lifecycle, VPN access, SSO authentication, and Microsoft 365 administration across 1K+ users and 6 locations.

- Troubleshot endpoint and site connectivity issues including VPN, DNS, DHCP, and LAN, building networking fundamentals directly transferable to cloud VPC routing, subnet design, and access control architecture.

### US NAVY | Boatswain's Mate
**Jan 2010 – Mar 2014 | USS Lake Champlain, San Diego, CA**

- Executed mission-critical operations within a high-risk, compliance-driven environment, developing production-grade discipline in incident response, operational ownership, and procedural execution under pressure.

- Coordinated across engineering, navigation, and command units under strict chain-of-command governance, reinforcing structured accountability, risk assessment, and authority boundaries applicable to access control, security governance, and platform reliability.
