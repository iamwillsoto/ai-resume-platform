## PROJECTS

### Prompt Deployment Pipeline | Amazon Bedrock + S3 + GitHub Actions  
*Use Case: Automate AI-powered content creation and publishing for static sites.*

- Created a GitHub-based CI/CD workflow to process prompt templates and config files  
- Built a Python script (`process_prompt.py`) that:  
  - Loads and renders prompt templates using variables from config files  
  - Sends structured prompts to Amazon Bedrock for content generation  
  - Saves outputs as `.html` or `.md` files and uploads to S3 for static website hosting  
- Used environment-specific prefixes (`beta/`, `prod/`) to separate test and live content  
- Managed workflow triggers using PRs and merges, with secrets securely handled in GitHub Actions  

### Multilingual Audio Pipeline | Amazon Transcribe + Translate + Polly + S3 + GitHub Actions  
*Use Case: Automate voice-to-voice translation for .mp3 content.*

- Developed a Python script (`process_audio.py`) to:  
  - Upload input .mp3 files to S3  
  - Transcribe English audio using Amazon Transcribe  
  - Translate text into other languages with Amazon Translate  
  - Generate multilingual speech using Amazon Polly  
  - Save outputs to structured S3 paths for `transcripts/`, `translations/`, and `audio_outputs/`  
- Automated processing via GitHub Actions workflows for both PR (beta) and main (prod) branches  
- Used GitHub Secrets to securely manage AWS credentials and environment variables  

### Two-Tier Web Architecture on AWS | EC2 + RDS + VPC  
*Use Case: Deploy a secure and scalable content management website.*

- Launched a custom VPC with public and private subnets, configured routing tables and Internet Gateway  
- Deployed CMS on an Ubuntu EC2 instance (web tier), with MySQL database hosted on Amazon RDS (database tier)  
- Hardened networking using security groups and subnet isolation (EC2 in public, RDS in private)  
- Verified application connectivity and documented the benefits of two-tier architecture  

### EC2 Shutdown Automation | AWS Lambda + GitHub Actions + CloudFormation  
*Use Case: Reduce unnecessary EC2 runtime costs for non-production environments.*

- Built a Python Lambda function using `boto3` to identify and stop EC2 instances based on state and tags  
- Scheduled shutdowns via Amazon EventBridge  
- Created an S3-hosted deployment package and used CloudFormation templates to deploy the Lambda with IAM roles  
- Automated deployment using separate GitHub Actions workflows for beta and prod environments  
- Managed environment-specific parameters and AWS credentials using GitHub Secrets
