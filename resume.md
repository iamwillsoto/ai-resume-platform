## EXPERIENCE

### HD SUPPLY | Cloud Infrastructure Engineer (Contract)
**Jun 2024 – Present**
- Engineered segmented multi-VPC AWS architecture with Transit Gateway centralized routing, enforcing deterministic east-west traffic control and isolating production workloads to reduce cross-environment risk exposure.
- Standardized Route 53 DNS governance across environments including public/private hosted zone separation and routing policies, improving resolution reliability and eliminating ad hoc DNS sprawl.
- Established infrastructure security baselines using KMS encryption enforcement, scoped IAM role hierarchies, and RBAC boundaries to reduce standing privilege and minimize blast radius across workloads.
- Automated compliance reporting workflows using Lambda and PowerShell, converting Security Hub and Inspector findings into structured audit artifacts and reducing manual evidence collection by 60%.

### LEVELUPINTECH | Cloud Engineer
**Feb 2024 – Oct 2025**
- Architected secure multi-tier AWS infrastructure using Terraform Cloud across ALB, Auto Scaling, and RDS with private subnet isolation and repeatable IaC convergence across multiple Availability Zones.
- Designed reusable VPC patterns with structured subnet segmentation, route table propagation control, and NAT egress standardization to enforce predictable traffic behavior across environments.
- Hardened security posture with GuardDuty integration, AWS Config rule validation, and KMS encryption standards across compute and storage layers.
- Integrated managed AI capabilities into cloud infrastructure by provisioning Amazon Bedrock pipelines with throttling-aware fallback logic and DynamoDB persistence across isolated environments.

### VERIZON | Cloud Support Engineer
**Jan 2021 – Mar 2024**
- Operated enterprise AWS production environments supporting high-availability workloads with 99.9%+ SLA adherence across multiple environments.
- Resolved complex incidents involving VPC routing conflicts, DNS resolution failures, security group misconfigurations, and load balancer inconsistencies, contributing to a 25% MTTR reduction.
- Executed controlled infrastructure modifications using Terraform and CloudFormation within governed IAM boundaries, ensuring policy-compliant change execution.
- Implemented CloudWatch monitoring and alerting patterns to detect degradation before customer impact.
