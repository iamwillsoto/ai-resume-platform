## EXPERIENCE

### LEVELUPINTECH | Cloud Engineer
**Sep 2023 – Feb 2024**

- Architected secure multi-tier AWS infrastructure by engineering modular Terraform Cloud configurations across ALB, Auto Scaling, and RDS with private subnet isolation, identity-scoped security group boundaries, and zero-drift IaC convergence across multiple Availability Zones.

- Designed and provisioned event-driven serverless infrastructure using Lambda, S3, API Gateway, and EventBridge, establishing reusable architecture patterns across fully isolated beta and production environments.

- Hardened cloud security posture across all provisioned environments by enforcing least-privilege IAM boundaries, deploying GuardDuty for continuous threat detection, and implementing KMS encryption identity-scoped at every infrastructure tier.

- Automated EC2 lifecycle governance and IAM access management by engineering Lambda and EventBridge workflows with tag-based enforcement and full DynamoDB audit logging, eliminating idle resource accumulation with zero production impact.

- Provisioned and managed containerized infrastructure by deploying Docker Swarm across multi-node clusters with secrets-managed credentials, durable volume persistence, and control plane-enforced failure recovery.

- Integrated AI capabilities into cloud infrastructure by provisioning Amazon Bedrock pipelines with throttling-aware fallback logic and DynamoDB analytics persistence across structurally isolated environments, delivered via GitHub Actions CI/CD.

- Enforced infrastructure compliance and auditability by implementing OIDC federated authentication, structured CloudWatch audit logging, and CI repository validation across 8+ projects, eliminating long-lived credentials from every deployment workflow.

- Standardized multilingual content infrastructure using Transcribe, Translate, and Polly with automated Lambda event execution and Terraform IaC, reducing manual processing overhead to zero.

### LIFE TIME FITNESS | IT Service Desk Technician
**Sep 2014 – Aug 2020 | Burlington, MA**

- Escalation point for enterprise identity and access issues, managing Active Directory account lifecycle, VPN access, SSO authentication, and Microsoft 365 administration across 1K+ users and 6 locations.

- Troubleshot endpoint and site connectivity issues including VPN, DNS, DHCP, and LAN, building the networking foundation behind cloud VPC design, subnet segmentation, and access control architecture.

### US NAVY | Boatswain's Mate
**Jan 2010 – Mar 2014 | USS Lake Champlain, San Diego, CA**

- Executed mission-critical operations under strict safety, compliance, and readiness standards in high-risk environments demanding procedural accuracy and rapid decision-making under pressure.

- Coordinated across engineering, navigation, and command units under chain-of-command governance, enforcing accountability, decisive judgment, and precision in high-stakes environments.
