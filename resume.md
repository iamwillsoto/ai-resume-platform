## EXPERIENCE

### LEVELUPINTECH | Cloud Engineer
**Sep 2023 – Feb 2024**
- Architected secure multi-tier AWS infrastructure using Terraform Cloud across ALB, Auto Scaling, and RDS with private subnet isolation and identity-scoped security group enforcement across multiple Availability Zones.
- Designed reusable VPC architectures including subnet segmentation, route tables, NAT gateways, and least-privilege IAM boundaries for structurally isolated beta and production environments.
- Hardened cloud security posture by enforcing KMS encryption, GuardDuty monitoring, AWS Config rule enforcement, and IAM permission boundary design across all provisioned tiers.
- Automated EC2 lifecycle governance and IAM access management using Lambda and EventBridge workflows with DynamoDB audit logging, eliminating idle resource accumulation with zero production impact.
- Provisioned and managed containerized infrastructure using Docker Swarm across multi-node clusters with secrets-managed credentials and durable volume persistence.
- Integrated managed AI capabilities into cloud infrastructure by provisioning Amazon Bedrock pipelines with throttling-aware fallback logic across structurally isolated environments, delivered via GitHub Actions with federated OIDC authentication.
- Enforced infrastructure auditability by implementing structured CloudWatch logging and eliminating long-lived credentials across 8+ deployment pipelines.
